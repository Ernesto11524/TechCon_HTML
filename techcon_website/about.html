            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2012 as a small regional meetup for 
                software developers and tech enthusiasts in Accra, 
                Ghana. What started as an informal gathering of fewer 
                than 100 attendees has grown into one of Africa’s most 
                recognized and forward-thinking technology conferences. 
                The goal from the beginning was simple: to create a 
                space where innovation, collaboration, and learning 
                could flourish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, TechCon has evolved from a single-track 
                developer event into a multi-day, multi-track international 
                conference attracting thousands of participants from 
                across the globe. Each year has marked a significant step 
                forward—whether it was the introduction of the Women in 
                Tech panel in 2015, the launch of startup showcases in 
                2018, or the pivot to hybrid conferencing in response to 
                the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evolution of TechCon mirrors the explosive growth of 
                the tech industry in Africa and beyond. By consistently 
                embracing change and championing inclusion, TechCon has 
                helped shape the careers of countless developers, 
                entrepreneurs, and students. With each edition, it 
                reaffirms its commitment to pushing the boundaries of 
                what's possible in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we look ahead to TechCon 2024, we also honor 
                the legacy of past conferences that laid the foundation. 
                From humble beginnings to a thriving tech movement, the 
                history of TechCon is a testament to what’s possible 
                when passionate people come together to build the future.
